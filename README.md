# League of Legends Profiler (lol-profiler)

# Active GitHub Pages Link
- https://husamsaleem.github.io/lol-profiler/

# Description
- You can enter a league username into the search bar and the server will return some of the previous matches of this player as well as some profile information.

# Why I made it
- I made this to learn JavaScript/HTML/CSS mainly. I also incorporated a back-end server made in nodeJs with the express framework to hide the api key. I deployed this server in a Heroku app.

# Where is the server?
- There server repository is currently private because I do not want to expose the API key. However, if you really want to see it, message me.
